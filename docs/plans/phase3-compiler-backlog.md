# Phase 3 Compiler Backlog

> Audit performed against `~/.claude/plans/moonlit-napping-origami.md` ("Phase 3 — SPM Transformation Pass") and the existing repo state.

---

## A. What is in place (works as plumbing, but see §C)

The skeleton of Phase 3 is wired end-to-end:

- `compiler/third_party/cpu/lib/TritonCPUTransforms/ConvertMemoryToSPM.cpp`
  - GEMM K-loop pattern (`transformGemmLoop`, 2 dot-feeding loads).
  - Reduction pattern (`transformReductionLoop`, 1 non-dot tiled load).
  - Pass option `spm-base` / `spm-size` declared in `Passes.td`.
- `compiler/include/triton/Dialect/TritonCPU/IR/SPMAttrs.h`
  - Single source of truth for `kSPMAddressSpace = 3`, included by both Phase 2 and Phase 3 files.
- `compiler/third_party/cpu/lib/TritonCPUToLLVM/TypeConverter.cpp`
  - Explicit `addTypeAttributeConversion` callback for `memref<…, 3>` → `!llvm.ptr<3>`.
- `compiler/third_party/cpu/triton_cpu.cc`
  - pybind `add_convert_memory_to_spm(pm, spmBase, spmSize)` registered.
- `compiler/third_party/cpu/backend/compiler.py` (lines 216–221)
  - SPM pass inserted inside `make_tttcir()` under `_AOT_MODE`, with env-var overrides `TRITON_SPM_BASE` / `TRITON_SPM_SIZE`.
  - DMA-to-LLVM pass inserted in `make_llir()` (line 303).
- Tests:
  - `compiler/test/TritonCPU/convert-memory-to-spm.mlir` (lit, FileCheck).
  - `compiler/test/TritonCPU/dma-ops-to-llvm.mlir` (lit, FileCheck).
  - `compiler/test/TritonCPU/spm-address-space.mlir` (lit, pins `memref<…, 3>` → `!llvm.ptr<3>` contract).
  - `compiler/python/test/unit/cpu/test_dma.py` (DMA dialect parsing + lowering).

These are the only Phase-3 deliverables that should be considered "done".

## B. Audit Findings And Remaining Work

This section preserves the original audit findings, but the final status is
tracked in §E. Several items that were blockers in the first audit are now
resolved; only the explicitly open P1 / deferred items remain active backlog.

### 3a. GEMM double-buffering — **mostly resolved** (P0 #1, #3, #5; writeback deferred to Phase 4b)

1. ~~**No real compute/DMA overlap.**~~ Resolved by P0 #3. The GEMM path now
   prefetches before `read_current` / compute and waits at the end of the
   iteration; measured overlap is recorded in
   `../archive/matmul-spm-lowering-closure.md`.
2. **No SPM writeback for output tile.** Phase 3 plan keeps writeback in §4b, but the GEMM pass should at least leave a hook (or stop transforming when the output is also SPM-resident). Today the C tile still goes through cacheable `vector.transfer_write`.
3. ~~**MVP gating leaves all current workloads untransformed.**~~ Resolved for
   `matmul`; `vector_add` is intentionally not transformed, and `layer_norm`
   remains blocked on reduction matcher generalization.

### 3b. Reduction prefetch — **partially resolved** (P0 #2 race fix done; single-load double buffering done; matcher generalization remains P1 #11)

1. ~~**Single-buffer race (correctness bug).**~~ Resolved by reordering:
   read current → reduce → prefetch → `dma_wait`. The single-load tiled
   reduction path now uses two SPM buffers with a prologue prefetch, per-iteration
   `dma_wait`, alternate-buffer prefetch, and flipped buffer index. Tiny
   reductions remain MMIO/control-heavy even after overlap.
2. **Pattern is too narrow** (`nonDotLoads.size() == 1`). LayerNorm's normalisation pass loads `x`, `gamma`, `beta` in the same loop; the matcher rejects it. Generalise to "all loads share the same induction variable as their leading index, and total tile bytes ≤ SPM".

### 3c. Three-tier data-placement policy — **MVP landed** (see `three-tier-placement.md` M1-M8; coverage audited 2026-04-29)

> ✅ Tier 2/3 MVP plumbing implemented via `three-tier-placement.md` M1-M8: `SPMSpaceManager`、`SPMTensorPlacement` pass、JSON sidecar、launcher `_alloc/_free_all`、harness 改造。覆盖审计完成：`matmul` 正常命中 Tier 3；`vector_add` 空 JSON 是设计预期（无循环）；`layer_norm` 需 kernel 改写 + matcher 泛化。详见 `three-tier-placement.md` §4.1。

The table below reflects the state after the 2026-04-29 audit; see `three-tier-placement.md` for full details.

| Required piece | Status |
|---|---|
| `has_scalar_reuse` analysis on Triton/TTCIR | ✅ implemented in `SPMTensorPlacement` |
| Tier classification per tensor (size vs SPM, scalar reuse) | ✅ implemented (matmul args → Tier 3) |
| Compiler-driven choice of cacheable vs uncacheable allocation | ✅ implemented via `_alloc` dispatch |
| Harness API to allocate in cacheable / uncacheable / SPM regions | ✅ all 3 harnesses use `<kernel>_alloc` |
| L2-warming experimental verification (Tier 2) | ✅ completed — see `../evidence/l2_warming.md` |
| `verify-spm-fires` tooling | ✅ `make verify` / `make verify-<kernel>` |

### 3d. Loop boundary handling — **RESOLVED** (P0 #6)

> ✅ Compile-time bail-out added. See §E P0 #6.

Plan §3 requires MVP guard: `K % BLOCK_K == 0`. Neither `transformGemmLoop` nor `transformReductionLoop` checks or asserts this. If a workload violates the alignment assumption, the final DMA will read past the tensor boundary.

Fix: add a compile-time assert (or emit a runtime guard that skips the SPM path) when the trip count is not provably a multiple of the tile size.

### Phase-3 plumbing items still missing (raised in `../archive/phase2.md`)

1. ~~`DMA_MMIO_BASE` / `DMA_REG_*` are `static constexpr` in `DmaOpsToLLVM.cpp:37-44`.~~ ✅ Resolved. `DmaOpsToLLVM` now exposes `dma-mmio-base`, and the AOT pipeline forwards `TRITON_DMA_MMIO_BASE`.
2. ~~No `useXspmInsn` switch on `DmaOpsToLLVM`.~~ ✅ Resolved. The pass now exposes `use-xspm-insn` / `TRITON_USE_XSPM_INSN`; the switch currently fails explicitly until the Phase 4d instruction path exists.
3. ~~**Default-size mismatch**~~ ✅ Resolved. All unified to 256 KiB. See §E P0 #4.

---

## C. Quality review of the parts marked "done"

### 1. `transformGemmLoop` (correctness + brittleness)

- ~~**A/B identification is brittle.**~~ Resolved for the standard GEMM fallback/fused path. The matcher now identifies A/B by asking `analyzeGemmContract()` whether the two reads are the `vector.contract` lhs/rhs, and retries with reversed read order before deciding the loop is not a supported GEMM.
- ~~**Cloned-read rediscovery via `getLoc()` is fragile** (`:401-408`).~~ Resolved. Cloned reads are now recovered through `IRMapping::lookupOrNull(read.getResult())`, avoiding location-based collisions.
- **`dotLoads.size() != 2` rejects valid GEMMs**: a single-load `gemv`, a 3-input fused matmul, or anything else with extra loads inside the K-loop is silently passed through.
- ~~**Non-overlapping prefetch (§B.3a above)**~~ — resolved for GEMM; keep
  watching this shape if `transformGemmLoop` is refactored.
- **Unused `TiledLoadInfo::feedsDot` for non-dot loads** is fine, but the early `return false` cases in `transformGemmLoop` leave the IR partially mutated — verify that the prologue DMAs are not emitted before the bail-out (currently they are; `:328-332` runs before the failure path on lines `:411`/`:325`).

### 2. `SplitLargeContract` (new pass)

- ✅ Correctness verified: 256×256×256 / 32×32×32 PASS 65536/65536.
- ✅ DMA re-priming: `collectPrologueDma` correctly skips `isPure()` ops between DMA enqueues and the loop.
- **Only matches standard GEMM contract** (`(m,k)×(k,n)→(m,n)`). Non-standard layouts or batched contracts are silently skipped.
- **Clones full prologue DMA ops** including their operands. If `ConvertMemoryToSPM` changes the prologue structure (e.g. adds non-DMA side-effecting ops between enqueues), `collectPrologueDma` may collect fewer ops than expected.
- **`microM` default is 4**. Optimal value depends on VLEN and LMUL; currently hardcoded via `TRITON_MICRO_M` env var.
- **B tile is re-loaded 8× per K-iteration** (once per micro-loop). This is the cost of separate loops — each micro-loop independently loads the full B tile from SPM. Not a correctness issue but a known performance trade-off vs. a hypothetical shared-B approach.

### 3. `transformReductionLoop`

- ~~**Correctness bug** (race) documented in §B.3b.1.~~ Resolved by
  reordering the single-buffer prefetch after the current read.
- ~~**2-D non-leading-IV prefetch offset bug.**~~ Resolved on 2026-04-30 by
  using the stride of the dimension indexed by the IV instead of always
  using `strides[0]`; covered by `@reduction_2d_non_leading_iv`.
- ~~**Remaining performance issue:** the path is still single-buffered, so DMA
  latency is serially exposed.~~ Resolved for the single-load reduction path.
  The remaining LayerNorm/softmax work is matcher generalization for loops with
  multiple loads.

### 4. `DmaOpsToLLVM.cpp` (Phase 2 lowering, used by Phase 3)

- Register layout, fence positions, MMIO offsets all line up with `simulator/src/scratchpad_mem/libspm.h`. Good.
- `addIllegalOp<DmaEnqueue2DOp, DmaWaitOp>()` is set in `TritonLLVMConversionTarget` (`:54-55`) — the `../archive/phase2.md` concern is resolved.
- Inline-asm `fence iorw, iorw` instead of `LLVM::FenceOp(seq_cst)` — comment in source explains why. Keep.

### 5. SPM buffer layout correctness

Plan §3 specifies a precise buffer address layout:

| Buffer | Address |
|--------|---------|
| spm_a0 | `SPM_BASE + 0` |
| spm_a1 | `SPM_BASE + tile_a` |
| spm_b0 | `SPM_BASE + 2×tile_a` |
| spm_b1 | `SPM_BASE + 2×tile_a + tile_b` |

Verified in P0 #7: A_front=0x0, A_back=+0x400, B_front=+0x800,
B_back=+0xC00 for the 64x64 / 16x16 matmul smoke case.

### 6. End-to-end pipeline integration

- `compiler.py:216-221` inserts the SPM pass and `:303` lowers the DMA ops. Both gated on `_AOT_MODE`. Good.
- `matmul` now exercises the pass in production. `vector_add` remains a
  designed no-op, and `layer_norm` needs the reduction matcher work in §E.

### 7. Tests

- `convert-memory-to-spm.mlir` exercises the pass on synthetic IR that already contains `vector.transfer_read` from `memref` (i.e. the post-`ConvertMemoryOps` form). It does **not** prove that anything from a Triton kernel actually reaches that form. The lit test passing tells us the pattern matches; it does **not** tell us the pattern fires in production.

---

## D. End-to-end verification gap — **RESOLVED** (P0 #1)

> ✅ `matmul/kernel.py` rewritten to `tl.make_block_ptr`; LLIR now contains `addrspace(3)` loads and `fence iorw` DMA sequences. See §E P0 #1.

The description below reflects the state at initial audit time.

```bash
$ rg 'addrspace\(3\)|fence iorw|store volatile' workloads/*/build/*.llir
# (no matches in matmul.llir or layer_norm.llir)
```

Root cause: `workloads/matmul/kernel.py` and `workloads/layer_norm/kernel.py` use **pointer arithmetic** (`a_ptrs += BLOCK_SIZE_K`), not `tl.make_block_ptr`. In `compiler/third_party/cpu/lib/TritonToTritonCPU/ConvertMemoryOps.cpp`, only the `triton::isTensorPointerType(ptr)` branch produces the canonical `vector.transfer_read %memref[%idx]` form (`:179-209`). The pointer-arithmetic branch falls into `lowerToContiguousRowMajor` / `lowerToScalarLoads`, which emit gather-style or scalar loads — those do not match `findTiledLoads` in `ConvertMemoryToSPM.cpp`.

Two ways forward:

1. Rewrite the workloads to use `tl.make_block_ptr` + `tt.advance` (smallest delta to the compiler).
2. Teach `ConvertMemoryToSPM` to recognise the contiguous-row-major form as well (broader, but harder).

Either way, **until this is fixed nothing in Phase 3 is actually exercised in production** — the unit tests pass on hand-written IR, but the production pipeline is a no-op.

---

## E. Concrete Backlog Items

### P0 — blocks any benchmark / paper number

1. ~~**Make the pass actually fire on a real workload.**~~
   ✅ Done. Rewrote `matmul/kernel.py` to `tl.make_block_ptr`. LLIR now contains `addrspace(3)` loads and `fence iorw` DMA sequences.
2. ~~**Fix the reduction single-buffer race**~~ (`ConvertMemoryToSPM.cpp:637-650`)
   ✅ Done. Reordered `enqueue` after `read`.
3. ~~**Reorder GEMM body for real compute/DMA overlap.**~~
   ✅ Done. Prefetch issued before `read_current`/compute; `dma_wait` at end of iteration.
4. ~~**Reconcile the three SPM-size defaults.**~~
   ✅ Done. All unified to 256 KiB (`Passes.td`, `compiler.py`, `env.sh`, `run_spm.py`).
5. ~~**Verify on gem5.**~~
   ✅ Done. matmul / vector_add / layer_norm all PASS in both SPM and cache_baseline modes.
   - DMA plumbing: 128 transfers / 4096 SPM reads / 2048 SPM writes for matmul.
   - **Root cause found** for Bug A (row 14 errors) and Bug B (tile_n=3 errors): both were a single bug — `SpmDmaEngine::translateAddr()` only translated the start of each DMA row read, but in gem5 SE mode consecutive virtual pages are not mapped to consecutive physical pages, so any row read crossing a 4 KiB VA boundary fetched garbage from `PA_start + 0x1000`.
   - **Fix**: added `issuePagedDmaAction()` in `spm_dma_engine.cc` that splits any DMA read/write at VA page boundaries, translates each chunk separately, and fires the row's `doneEvent` once all sub-actions complete. Applied to all four issue sites (1D read, 1D write-back, 2D row read, 2D row write).
   - **Cache-collision fix in Triton**: `make matmul` and `make matmul-nospm` shared the same `~/.triton/cache` because `TRITON_DISABLE_SPM` is not part of `CPUOptions.hash()`. `build_kernel.sh` now exports `TRITON_CACHE_DIR=~/.triton/cache_nospm` for the no-SPM build so the two LLIRs do not collide.
6. ~~**Verify loop boundary guard.**~~
   ✅ Done. Compile-time bail-out added.
7. ~~**Verify SPM buffer layout addresses.**~~
   ✅ Done. Layout confirmed: A_front=0x0, A_back=+0x400, B_front=+0x800, B_back=+0xC00.

### P0+ — start immediately after P0 completes (Phase 3 core claim)

8. ~~**Design Tier classification framework (§3c).**~~
   ✅ Done. `SPMTensorPlacement` pass implements `has_scalar_reuse` analysis, tier decision table, JSON sidecar export, and launcher `_alloc/_free_all` generation. See `three-tier-placement.md` M1-M8.

### P1 — Phase 3 spec compliance

9. ~~**Implement Tier classification (§3c).**~~
   ✅ Done. `SPMTensorPlacement` pass tags each tensor arg with tier 1/2/3. Launcher dispatches to `spm_malloc`/`malloc`/`dma_buf_malloc`. Coverage audit (2026-04-29): matmul → Tier 3; vector_add/layer_norm → no eligible tensors. See `three-tier-placement.md` §4.1.
10. **Robust GEMM matcher.**
    - ~~Derive A/B identity from `vector.contract` lhs/rhs operands instead of transfer-read walk order.~~ ✅ Done for the standard GEMM fallback/fused path.
    - ~~Replace `getLoc()`-based cloned-read lookup with `IRMapping`-based lookup.~~ ✅ Done.
    - Allow >2 loads in the loop as long as exactly two feed the contract.
11. **Generalise reduction matcher** to "any number of loads sharing the loop IV", so LayerNorm's 3-load pass and softmax's typical body are accepted.
12. ~~**Make `DMA_MMIO_BASE` a pass option** on `DmaOpsToLLVM`, and add a `useXspmInsn` boolean (default off) so Phase 4d only needs to flip a flag.~~ ✅ Done. `use-xspm-insn` is present and intentionally errors until the instruction lowering is implemented.

### P1-deferred — explicitly out of Phase 3 scope

13. **SPM writeback for output tile** (C tile in GEMM, O tile in attention). Currently the C tile goes through cacheable `vector.transfer_write`. *(Deferred to Phase 4b per plan — not a Phase 3 deliverable, listed here for traceability.)*

### P2 — Tooling / verification

14. ~~**End-to-end smoke test**~~: ✅ Done. `make verify` / `make verify-<kernel>` builds both modes and checks LLIR for `addrspace(3)` + `fence iorw`, tier JSON non-empty, and launcher `_alloc/_free_all` presence.
15. ~~**Cache-baseline harness path.**~~ ✅ Done. `make cmp-<kernel>` runs both SPM and cache modes; `make run-<kernel>` runs SPM only. Unified via `run_experiment.py`.
16. ~~**Stats wiring**~~: ✅ Done. `compare_stats.py` extracts 21 symmetric + 15 SPM-only metrics into `.txt` tables and CSV (`--csv` / `--spm-only-csv`). Remaining: Phase 6 comparison tooling.

---

## F. P0-5 gem5 verification — matmul 869/4096 computation error investigation (RESOLVED)

### F.1 Earlier fix: VA→PA start-address translation

gem5 SE mode allocates physical pages from a free pool and maps them via the page table. The first iteration of the fix added `translateAddr(Addr vaddr)` using `process->pTable->translate()` to all DMA address calculations. This made `spm_probe` (single-row DMA) pass.

### F.2 Final fix: paged DMA splitting at VA boundaries

After F.1 the simple DMA round-trip worked, but matmul still produced 869/4096 errors. The remaining bug:

**Symptom**: certain rows whose 64-byte transfer crossed a 4 KiB virtual page boundary read garbage in the second half. Concretely, for `pid_m=0`, A's row 14 K-block 3 read `VA [0x86FD0, 0x87010)` which spans pages `0x86000` and `0x87000`. The two pages mapped to `PA 0x86000 → 0x7B000` and `PA 0x87000 → 0x80000` (non-consecutive). The DMA engine translated only `VA 0x86FD0 → PA 0x7BFD0` and then issued a single contiguous 64-byte read, so the last 16 bytes (cols 60–63) came from `PA 0x7C000+`, which contained whatever happened to live in the next physical page rather than the user's data at `PA 0x80000`. The accumulated FMA error showed up across every column of `acc[14]` because the corrupted A elements multiplied with the full B row.

The "tile_n=3" pattern (cols 52–63 wrong for every row) was the same bug at a different VA: the B prefetch for `pid_n=3` reads from `b_ptr + 192` and ran past a page boundary on every K-iteration whose row crossed one.

**Fix** (`spm_dma_engine.cc`):
- New helper `issuePagedDmaAction(cmd, vaddr, len, doneEvent, buf)` splits a single logical DMA action at every 4 KiB VA boundary, translates each chunk separately, and uses an auto-deleting wrapper event with a refcount so the original `doneEvent` fires only after all sub-actions complete.
- Replaced the four direct `dmaPort.dmaAction(...)` call sites: `beginRead()`, `readDone()`, `beginPipelinedRead()` (per-row read), `pipelinedRowReadDone()` (per-row write).

Verified: `make run-matmul-spm` PASS 4096/4096; `make run-vector_add-spm` and `make run-layer_norm-spm` also PASS. SPM stats: 4096 SPM reads, 2048 SPM writes, 128 DMA transfers for matmul.

### F.3 Compiler-side fix: Triton cache collision

`make matmul` and `make matmul-nospm` produced binaries that shared the same `~/.triton/cache` entry because `TRITON_DISABLE_SPM` is not part of `CPUOptions.hash()`. After the fix above, the cache_baseline run still page-faulted at `0xF0000000` because it was running an SPM-enabled binary out of the cache.

**Fix** (`workloads/scripts/build_kernel.sh`): when `--no-spm` is set, also export `TRITON_CACHE_DIR=~/.triton/cache_nospm` so the two cache trees never collide.

### F.4 Probe test files (in `workloads/matmul/`)

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `spm_probe.c` | Basic 1D DMA round-trip (PASS) |
| `row14_probe.c` | 2D DMA 16×16 to SPM with `src_stride=64` packed source — never crossed a page boundary, always passed |
| `rvv_matmul_probe.c` | Pure RVV intrinsic 16×16 matmul, no SPM (PASS) |
| `vrgather_probe.c` | `vrgather.vi` LMUL=2 correctness for indices 0–15 (PASS) |
| `spill_probe.c` | 16 LMUL=2 accumulators under register pressure (PASS) |
| `delta_analysis.c` | Offline hypothesis testing for row-14 error pattern (run natively) |
